          <div>Wildlife is a precious gift from God for this planet. The term "fauna" is not only for wild animals but also for all non-domesticated life forms including birds, insects, plants, fungi and even microscopic organisms. To maintain a healthy ecological balance on this land, animals, plants and marine species are as important as humans. Every organism on this earth has a unique place in the food chain that contributes to the ecosystem in its own way. But, unfortunately today, many animals and birds are endangered. </div>
          <div>Natural habitats of animals and plants are destroyed for land development and agriculture by humans. Poaching and hunting of animals for fur, jewellery, meat and leather are other important factors contributing to the extinction of wildlife. If soon, no rigorous measures are taken to save the fauna, it would not be long when they find a place on the list of extinct species. And that would not be all! The extinction of wild species will certainly have a fatal impact on the human race. So, for us as human beings, it becomes a great responsibility to save the wildlife, our planet and, most importantly, ourselves. Here are some other reasons for deep understanding why wildlife plays such an important role in maintaining an ecological balance on Earth.</div>
          <div>Thus, animals play an important role on our planet earth and in human lives. Therefore, it is our duty as humans to protect animals for a better future. Otherwise, the human race will not be able to survive without the help of the other animals.</div>
